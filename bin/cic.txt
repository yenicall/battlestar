  -b,--base BASE      Base directory to work in (default is $HOME of the user
                      that manager is run as, see --user).
  -u,--user USER      User to run manager as (default is strong-pm).
  -p,--port PORT      Listen on PORT for application deployment (default 8701).
  -n,--dry-run        Don't write any files.
  -j,--job-file FILE  Path of Upstart job to create (default is
                      `/etc/init/strong-pm.conf`).
  -f,--force          Overwrite existing job file if present.
  --upstart VERSION   Specify Upstart version, 1.4 or 0.6 (default is 1.4).
  --systemd           Install as a systemd service, not an Upstart job.

OS Service support:

The --systemd and --upstart VERSION options are mutually exclusive.  If neither
is specified, the service is installed as an Upstart job using a template that
assumes Upstart 1.4 or higher.
